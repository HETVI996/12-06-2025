## Regression 

Simple Linear 
Simple Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a value based on a single independent variable (feature). It finds a straight-line relationship between the input (X) and output (Y).

Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear Regression where we use two or more independent variables (features) to predict a dependent variable (output).

Polynomial Regression
Polynomial Regression is an extension of Linear Regression, where the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is curved instead of a straight line.


Support vector machine regression
Instead of finding a decision boundary (like in classification), SVR finds a best-fit hyperplane that predicts continuous values while ignoring small errors within a margin (Îµ-tube).

Decision Tree
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works like a flowchart, where decisions are made based on conditions (rules) at each step.
The dataset is split into smaller groups based on questions (conditions).
Each split leads to branches, forming a tree-like structure.
The process continues until the best decision is reached.

Random Forest Regression
Random Forest Regression is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family. It is an extension of decision tree regression, where multiple decision trees are combined to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting
